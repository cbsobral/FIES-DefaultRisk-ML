# The Project 

Our goal is to employ machine learning algorithms to predict loan default probabilities in the context of a Brazilian student loan program called FIES (Financiamento Estudantil). FIES is the most significant student loan program in Brazil. For instance, between 2009 and 2015, more than 2 million students got a loan through FIES. For the initial runs, we employ 5 methods: logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, linear support vector classification (SVC), and artificial neural networks (ANN). Random forest and ANN achieved the highest AUC scores so far. 

Our final objective is to find out which are the best performing models for this task as well as the predictive power of the features. 

## Module00
In this module we prepare the data and run preliminary analysis of features. 

## Module01
In this module we implement the machine learning methods and provide performance measures for the classification tasks.
